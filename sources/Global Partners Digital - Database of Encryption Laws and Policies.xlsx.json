These can be issued by a security or law enforcement agency, and ask, but do not require, the provider to take specified steps which would ensure that the provider is capable of giving certain types of help to the agency for purposes such as safeguarding national security or to enforce criminal law.\n\nTechnical assistance notices (sections 317L to 317RA). These can also be issued by a security or law enforcement agency and require the provider to take specified steps which would help the agency in relation to its functions relating to national security or enforcing the criminal law.\n\nTechnical capability notices (sections 317S to 317ZAA). These can only be issued by the Attorney-General and require the provider to do certain specified acts or things, related to technical capability, which ensure that the provider is capable of giving certain types of help to the security agencies, again, in relation to its functions relating to national security or enforcing the criminal law.\n\nAny request or notice must be reasonable and proportionate, and compliance must be practicable and technically feasible. The assessment of reasonableness and proportionality includes consideration of a number of specified factors, including whether the request or notice is \u201cnecessary\u201d as well as \u201cthe legitimate expectations of the Australian community relating to privacy\u201d.\n\nIn relation to encryption, a request or notice must not have the effect of \u201crequesting or requiring a designated communications provider to implement or build a systemic weakness, or a systemic vulnerability, into a form of electronic protection\u201d or \u201cpreventing a designated communications provider from rectifying a systemic weakness, or a systemic vulnerability, in a form of electronic protection\u201d (section 317ZG(1)). The Act explicitly states that such prohibited requests would include any which involve implementing or building new decryption capabilities in relation to a form of electronic protection as well as anything that would render systemic methods of authentication or encryption less effective (sections 317ZG(2) and (3)). Weaknesses and vulnerabilities are systemic if they affect \u201ca whole class of technology\u201d but are not if they are \u201cselectively introduced to one or more target technologies that are connected with a particular person\u201d (section 317B).\n\nFailure to comply with a technical assistance notice or a technical capability notice is an offence, punishable by up to 47,619 penalty units (AUD 9,999,990) if the provider is a body corporate and 238 penalty units (AUD 49,980) if it is not (section 317ZB).\n\nA copy of the Telecommunications Act 1997 can be found here.

These are to be able to access the data, to copy the data; or to convert the data into documentary form or another form intelligible to the constable.\n\nIn order to grant the order, the magistrate must be satisfied of three things. First, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidential material is held in, or is accessible from, the computer or data storage device. Second, that the specified person is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence, the owner or lessee of the computer or device (or an employee of them or a person engaged under a contract for services by them), a person who uses or has used that computer or device, or a person who is or was a system administrated for the system which includes the computer or device. Third, that the specified person has relevant knowledge of the computer or device or of measures applied to protect data held in, or accessible from, the computer or device. This could include knowledge of the password or other means by which the data has been encrypted and how it can be decrypted.\n\nFailure to comply with a requirement in such an order is a criminal offence, punishable by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment or 300 penalty units (63,000 AUD) in ordinary cases, and by up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment or 600 penalty units (124,000 AUD) where the order relates to a serious offence or a serious terrorism offence.\n\nThe Crimes Act 1914 can be found here.

Various lower courts have followed this decision, although the Supreme Court of Canada has not ruled on this issue. The federal government has also recognised that it has no legislative authority to compel individuals to provide a password in the course of a criminal investigation.\n\nIn some cases, law enforcement may attempt, using various technical and investigative means to circumvent the protections afforded by encryption or to acquire an individual\u2019s private key or password. When an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information sought, the constitution generally requires law enforcement to secure prior judicial authorisation (normally on a \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d standard) for the search, seizure, or interception of the data sought. In some cases, additional legal safeguards may also apply.\n\nSection 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires not only that the search is reasonable, but that the search is conducted in a reasonable manner. This aspect of the section 8 analysis may serve to limit certain methods of circumventing encryption which are clearly disproportionate or prejudicial.

Nor does it require them to ensure that surveillance agencies have the ability to decrypt any telecommunication (section 10(4)). \n\nTogether, these duties mean that network operators cannot design and implement end-to-end encryption.\n\nUnder section 24 of the Act, where a network operator or service provider is shown an interception warrant which has been issued to a surveillance authority, it must assist the surveillance agency. This assistance includes \u201ctaking all other reasonable steps that are necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the warrant or lawful authority\u201d, including decrypting telecommunications where they have provided the encryption. As with the duties under sections 9 and 10, this does not, however, require them to decrypt telecommunications that were encrypted by a product supplied by them as an agent for that product, or supplied by another person where the product is available to the public (section 24(4)). Nor does it require them to ensure that surveillance agencies have the ability to decrypt any telecommunication (section 24(4)).\n\nA copy of the law can be found here.

This could include a requirement that they decrypt information which is necessary to access a particular device. The search power cannot be used to require the specified person give any information tending to incriminate them (section 130(2)), however this does not prevent a person exercising a search power from requiring the specified person to provide information or providing assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow the person exercising the search power to access data held in, or accessible from, a computer system or other data storage device that contains or may contain information tending to incriminate the specified person (section 130(3)). \n\nFailure to assist a person exercising a search power when requested to do so under section 130(1), without reasonable excuse, is a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment for up to three months (section 178).\n\nA copy of the law can be found here.

Where the key or code is in the possession of another person, the relevant security agency must request that person to disclose it. Instead of providing a key or code, a licensee or person may disclose any encryptioned or protected communication in an intelligible form.\n\nFailure to comply with a requirement is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to NGN 5,000,000.00, and where the offence continues, an additional daily default penalty of NGN 500,000.00.

A technical capability notice may be issued if three requirements are met (s. 253(2)).\n\nFirst, the Secretary of State must considers that the notice is necessary to ensure that the provider has the capability to provide any assistance that they may be required to provide in relation to interception, obtaining communications data or equipment interference authorised by the Act (s. 253(1)(a)).\n\nSecond, the Secretary of State must considers that the conduct required by the notice is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct (s. 253(1)(b)).\n\nThird, the decision to give the notice must have been approved by a Judicial Commissioner. A Judicial Commissioner is a specially appointed judge, and, when deciding whether to approve a notice, must consider whether the notice is necessary and proportionate (s. 253(1)(c)).\n\nThe obligations that can be included in a technical capability notice are to set out in secondary legislation, the Investigatory Powers (Technical Capability) Regulations 2018. While the Regulations don\u2019t explicitly refer to the ability to decrypt communications, they do include the capability to \u201cdisclose the content of communications or secondary data in an intelligible form where reasonably practicable\u201d and to \u201cremove electronic protection applied by or on behalf of the telecommunications operator to the communications or data where reasonably practicable\u201d. Where the Secretary of State is considering whether to issue a notice which requires the removal of electronic protection, they must take into account the technical feasibility and likely cost of compliance. (s. 255(4)).\n\nFailure to comply with obligations in a technical capability notice is not a criminal offence, but can be enforced through the civil courts.\n\nSection 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 contains powers for the security and law enforcement agencies in relation to \u201cprotected information\u201d i.e. electronic data which, without the key to the data, cannot, or cannot readily, be accessed or put into an intelligible form. Where protected information has come into the hands of an agency, they may, usually with a requirement for written permission from a judge, impose a disclosure requirement upon a person if they reasonably believe that:\n\n\u2022        a key to the protected information is in the possession of a person;\n\u2022        that a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information is necessary in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, or to secure the effective exercise or proper performance of any statutory power or duty;\n\u2022        that a disclosure requirement is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by its imposition; and\n\u2022        it is not reasonably for the person with the appropriate permission to obtain possession of the protected information in an intelligible form without a disclosure requirement.\n\nUnder section 50, where a disclosure requirement has been made, the person to whom it is directed must use any key in his possession to obtain access to the information, or to put it into an intelligible form, and make a disclosure of the information in an intelligible form. Alternatively, the person can disclosure the key itself.\n\nFailure to comply with a disclosure requirement is a criminal offence punishable in ordinary cases by imprisonment of up to two years\u2019, a fine, or both.
