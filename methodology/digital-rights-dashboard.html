transformation</h2><p>UNDP advocates for rights based, inclusive, whole-of-society digital transformation. It is a coordinated approach between government, civil society and the private sector to support human-centred design, mitigate risks, and establish accountability. However, digital transformation in the absence of a clearly defined framework of rights comes with several potential harms to individuals and consumers and undermines the trust that people repose in digital ecosystems.</p><p class="pb-[12px] sm:pb-[12px] md:pb-[35px] lg:pb-[35px]">This is why across the United Nations System, human rights have been recognized as integral to digital uptake and transformation. The Secretary-General&#x27;s 2020<!-- --> <!-- --><a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/action-for-human-rights/index.shtml" class="url-styling" target="_blank">Call to Action on Human Rights: Our Common Agenda</a> <!-- -->includes consideration of the application of human rights frameworks and standards in the digital space. As per the<!-- --> <!-- --><a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/" class="url-styling" target="_blank">United Nations Secretary General&#x27;s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation,</a> <!-- -->Human rights apply online just as they do offline. Digital technologies provide new means to exercise human rights, but they are too often also used to violate them. Data protection and privacy issues, the throttling of free speech online, the use of surveillance technologies, and online violence and harassment, are of particular concern. This view reflects several United Nations resolutions.<!-- --></p><p class="pb-[12px] sm:pb-[12px] md:pb-[35px] lg:pb-[35px]">Consequently, the Digital Development Compass does not conceptualise &quot;digital human rights&quot; as new rights unique to the digital space but instead as the online application of rights that exist offline.</p><p><a href="https://digitalstrategy.undp.org/" class="url-styling" target="_blank">UNDP&#x27;s Digital Strategy</a> <!-- -->aims to apply this approach to the digital realm by collaborating with other entities in the UN system to promote inclusive and gender-sensitive approaches that address the needs of the most vulnerable.
