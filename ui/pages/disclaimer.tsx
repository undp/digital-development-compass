                The Digital Development Compass, maintained by the United
                Nations Development Programme (UNDP), aggregates publicly

                verify the accuracy or endorse the legitimacy of these data
                sources. Therefore, any information presented on the Digital

                It is important to note that the Digital Development Compass
                should not be utilized as a statistical tool. Due to the

                solely on the data presented on the Digital Development Compass
                for statistical analysis or decision-making purposes is strongly
                discouraged.
