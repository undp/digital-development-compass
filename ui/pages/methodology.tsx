                  <p>
                  'Digital transformation' is not a destination, but a journey. It is about using digital and technology
                   to improve the lives and livelihoods of individuals, communities, and countries. This ranges from improving public services, 
                   to tackling issues of marginalisation. 
                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    UNDP advocates for inclusive, whole-of-society digital transformation.
                    It is a coordinated approach between government, civil society and the private sector to build ownership,
                     support human-centred design, mitigate risks, and establish accountability. To support this strategy, UNDP has implemented
                      the Digital Transformation Framework to discover & compare progress across a range of key issues.

                  The Digital Development Compass (DDC) is constructed based on the {" "}

                    Inclusive Whole-Of-Society Digital Transformation framework
                    </a>&nbsp;endorsed by UNDP. The Digital Transformation Framework serves as a guide for stakeholders to align their efforts regarding inclusive digital
                     transformation and supports countries in their transformation process. It enables stakeholders to identify, structure, and prioritise their 
                     national digital transformation initiatives and agendas effectively.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The framework represents the encompassing structure for Digital Development within the UNDP. It is the result of an extensive study that 
                     examines various frameworks, implementation strategies, and methodologies employed by diverse organisations, including those in the private
                      sector, public sector, and international development agencies. Through this framework, UNDP aims to provide countries with a valuable resource for 
                      assessing and advancing their digital development journey, while considering the unique challenges and opportunities they may encounter along the way.<br></br> 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      The Digital Transformation Framework is structured into seven pillars, with each pillar being further subdivided into 25 sub-pillars. Each sub-pillar corresponds to a 
                      specific element of digital transformation. The sub-pillars encompass various individual indicators, which are used to calculate a country's Digital Transformation Score. 
                      These scores are then aligned with corresponding stages of digital transformation.

                  <p>
                  Indicator level scores are weighted and averaged into sub-pillar scores. Presently, all indicators are weighted equally. Alongside the sub-pillar score, a data availability rate is calculated. This is the percentage of indicators in the sub-pillar for which there is data available for a country.<br/><br/> 
                  Sub-pillar level scores are then weighted and averaged into pillar scores. All sub-pillars are also weighted equally.<br/><br/>
                  Where data for a country is not available for an indicator, this indicator is omitted from the calculation of a sub-pillar score. Instead, an average of the indicator data that is available is used. Similarly, where no data is available for a sub-pillar, this sub-pillar is omitted from the calculation of the overall pillar score.<br/><br/>
