# Digital Readiness Assessment
The Digital Nation Dashboard is key part of product. The tool provides rapid, high-level insights into a country's digital strengths and weaknesses. Intended as an "entry point" for increased engagement between governments, UNDP country offices, and a broad range of digital transformation experts. Through the lens of UNDP's Inclusive Whole-of-Society Digital Transformation Framework.

# Digital Nation Dashboard 
A snapshot of the digital state of a nation, this tool leverages our Inclusive Data Repository to visualize the various digital aspects of a country. The goal is unlocking a comparison of the country to peers to understand where they are and where they want to be. This includes comparisons against other countries, Regions, Sub-Regions, Intermediate-Regions, Categories (eg SIDS, LDC, LLDC), and Income levels. The Dashboard tracks progress over time and whether a country is improving or getting worse (and how dramatically). Within each country, data sets is visualized in a way to tell the story of that data. For instance, showing a map of coverage of 4G data connectivity overlaid with population to identify gaps, or showing mobile data penetration differences between genders vs as a part of the whole population. 

# Inclusive Digital Data Repository
Combining public international data sets on inclusive digital transformation with local country data sets and scoring them against our Stages of Digital Readiness (from 1 to 6). Leverages the [data manifest](data_manifest_instructions.md) to pull compile data sources and uses [Digital Assessment Data Framework Filename Matching](UNDP%20Digital%20Assessment%20Data%20Framework%20Filename%20Matching%20V7.xlsx) as the main source document for matching.
